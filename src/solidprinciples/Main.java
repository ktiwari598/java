 * S - Single Responsibility Principle -> A class should have only 1 reason to change/single responsibility
 *
 * O - Open Closed Principle -> Open for Extension & Closed for Modification
 *
 * L - Liskov Substitution Principle -> If B is child of A, then B should be ale to replace A, without breaking the program
 *
 * I - Interface Segregation Principle -> Interfaces should be designed such that client should not be forced to implement
 * unnecessary functions that they do not need
 *
 * D - Dependency Inversion Principle -> Class should depend on abstractions(interface or abstract classes) rather than concrete class
 * High level modules should not depend on low level modules, instead both should depend on abstraction

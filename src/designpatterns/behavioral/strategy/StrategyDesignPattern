The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables you to select an algorithm's behavior
at runtime. It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
This pattern allows a class to change its behavior without altering its code, providing flexibility and reusability.

Real-Life Example
Imagine a navigation app that helps you find routes to your destination. The app might offer different strategies
 (or algorithms) for calculating routes based on different preferences:

Shortest route to minimize distance.
Fastest route to minimize travel time.
Scenic route to enjoy beautiful views.
Each route option is a different strategy that the user can choose. The app uses the selected strategy to calculate
the route, and if the user wants a different route type, they can simply switch to another strategy without changing
the core functionality of the app.

Software Example
Let’s implement a payment processing system that can use different payment strategies. We could have payment options
like credit card, PayPal, or cryptocurrency, and the system can choose the payment method based on the user’s choice
 at runtime.

Step-by-Step Implementation
Define the Strategy Interface: Create an interface that defines the method all payment strategies will implement.

Implement Concrete Strategies: Implement different classes for each payment method, each following the PaymentStrategy
 interface.

Context Class: Create a class that uses a payment strategy and allows clients to set the strategy dynamically.

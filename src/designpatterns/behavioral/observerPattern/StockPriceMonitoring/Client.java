/**
 * Benefits of the Observer Pattern
 * Loose Coupling: The subject and observers are loosely coupled. The subject doesnâ€™t know the details
 * of the observers, only that they implement a common interface.
 * Easy to Add Observers: New observers can be added or removed without modifying the subject.
 * Scalability: Useful in scenarios where multiple parts of the system need to respond to the same event.

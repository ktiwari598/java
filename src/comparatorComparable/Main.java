/**
 * In summary, Comparator is designed to be used for custom comparison logic and provides a method that directly accepts
 * parameters for comparison, making it suitable for use with lambda expressions and functional programming constructs.
 * On the other hand, Comparable is more focused on defining natural ordering for objects and does not directly
 * provide a method for comparison, which is why it's not considered a functional interface.
